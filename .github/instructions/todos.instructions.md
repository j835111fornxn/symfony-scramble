<todos title="Phase 4: Routing Integration Completion" agentRequirement="Review steps frequently throughout the conversation and DO NOT stop between steps unless they explicitly require it. Keep the todos updated using the todo_write tool (do not edit this file).">
- [x] phase4-generator-injection: Update Generator constructor to inject SymfonyRouteManager 🔴
  _Added SymfonyRouteManager to Generator constructor. Autowiring in services.yaml will handle injection automatically._
- [x] phase4-generator-getroutes: Refactor Generator::getRoutes() to use SymfonyRouteManager instead of RouteFacade 🔴
  _Updated getRoutes() to call routeManager.getDocumentedRoutes() which handles @only-docs and exclusion checks. Simplified logic significantly._
- [x] phase4-routeinfo-adapter: Update RouteInfo to accept both Route and RouteAdapter in constructor 🔴
  _Updated RouteInfo constructor signature and added helper methods className() and methodName() to handle both Laravel format (Controller@method) and Symfony formats (Controller::method or [Controller::class, 'method'])_
- [-] phase4-remove-laravel-deps: Remove Laravel Route and other illuminate/* type references from core classes 🔴
  _Discovered that Generator and RouteInfo still have many Laravel type references and helper function calls. These need to be replaced with Symfony equivalents as part of broader migration (Phases 8-11)._
- [x] phase4-update-services: Update services.yaml to ensure Generator receives SymfonyRouteManager 🟡
  _No changes needed - autowiring in services.yaml automatically injects SymfonyRouteManager into Generator_
- [ ] phase4-scramble-routes: Update Scramble.php route registration methods for Symfony 🟢
  _This is lower priority as DocumentationController already handles route registration. May need to keep these methods for backward compatibility or deprecate them._
